## Installation

- Python 3.6
- Pyspark ML
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Project Overview
Sparkify is a music streaming platform data-set provided by Udacity in the data science for enterprise Nanodegree program. Within this platform, the users have the option to subscribe to the service as either a paid user, or a free user (including advertisements). As part if this project I have used this data-set to explore, identify and predict customer churn (when a customer cancels their subscription) based on particular features derived from the data. I have approached this 

The aim of this project is to develop machine-learning models to help Sparkify predict a particular customer who is likely to churn. This could be used to support additional marketing activities or promotional offers to help retain these customers.

## Data
The data analysed within this notebook is provided by Udacity as 'mini_sparkify_event_data.json'.
